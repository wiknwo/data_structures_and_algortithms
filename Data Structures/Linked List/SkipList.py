class SkipList:
    """
    Class representing skiplist as created by William Pugh

    A skip list is built in layers. The bottom layer is an ordinary ordered 
    linked list. Each higher layer acts as an "express lane" for the lists below, 
    where an element in layer i appears in layer i+1 with some fixed probability p 
    (two commonly used values for p are 1/2 or 1/4). On average, each element appears 
    in 1/(1-p) lists, and the tallest element (usually a special head element at the 
    front of the skip list) in all the lists. The skip list contains log_1/p(n) lists.

    In an ordinary sorted list, insert, delete, and search operations require sequential 
    traversal of the list. This results in O(n) performance per operation. Skip Lists allow 
    intermediate nodes in the list to be skipped during a traversal - resulting in an 
    expected performance of O(log n) per operation.

    Attributes:
        MAX_LEVEL(int): Constant denoting maximum number of levels in skip list
        P(float): Constant denoting fraction of nodes with level i pointers also having level i + 1 pointers
        header(SkipNode): Head of skiplist which is a dummy node
        level(int): Number of levels in skiplist i.e. SkipNode with highest level

    Methods:
        insert(key): Inserts SkipNode with key into skip list
        search(key): Searches for SkipNode with specified key in skip list
        erase(key): Deletes SkipNode with specified key from skip list if it exists
        random_level(): Generates random level at which to insert new SkipNode

        Before we start inserting the elements in the skip list we need

        in the list. Level does not depend on the number of elements in the node. 
        The level for node is decided by the following algorithm.

        __MAX_LEVEL is the upper bound on number of levels in the skip list. It can 
        be determined as â€“ L(N) = log_p/2(N). This algorithm assures that random level 
        will never be greater than __MAX_LEVEL. Here p is the fraction of the nodes

        the search path backwards from the target until reaching an element that appears in the next 
        higher list or reaching the beginning of the current list. Therefore, the total expected cost
