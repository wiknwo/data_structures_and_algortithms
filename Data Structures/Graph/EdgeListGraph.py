"""
Simple Graph: A graph with no self loops or parallel edges.

In an edge list, we maintain an unordered list of all 
edges. This minimally suffices, but there is no efficient 
way to locate a particular edge (u,v), or the set of all 
edges incident to a vertex v.

To represent an edge, we just have an array of two vertex 
numbers, or an array of objects containing the vertex numbers 
of the vertices that the edges are incident on. If edges 
have weights, add either a third element to the array or 
more information to the object, giving the edge's weight. 
Since each edge contains just two or three numbers, the 
total space for an edge list is O(E) where E is the number
of edges.

Edge lists are simple, but if we want to find whether the 
graph contains a particular edge, we have to search through 
the edge list. If the edges appear in the edge list in no 
particular order, that's a linear search through |E| edges.

|V| = n, |E| = m

************ ADVANTAGES ************
- Space-efficient for sparse graphs
- Iterating over edges is efficient
- Extremely simple representation

************ DISADVANTAGES ************
- Less space-efficient for dense graphs
- Edge weight lookup is O(E)
- This representation lacks structure

Question to think about: How can you organize an edge list 
to make searching for a particular edge take O(log(E)) time? 
The answer is a little tricky.

Answer: Sort the list by the 1st vertex in each edge, and 
then by 2nd vertex in each edge. The list is sorted, so we 
can now use a binary search on it. Our comparison is a little 
bit more complicated now. 

[v1,v2] < [v3,v4] if (v1 < v3) OR ( (v1 === v3) AND v2 < v4 )

If we have an edge [v1,v2] we do a binary search for [v1,v2] 
on the list. Time O(log E)

If your edges are not directed i.e. [v1,v2] is equivalent to 
[v2,v1] then perform a second search on the equivalent edge 
[v2,v1] if your first search wasn't successful. 
Double O(log E) is still O(log E).

Hope this makes sense -Cameron

        Method to perform Depth-First Traversal of entire graph.
        Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing 
        or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm 
        starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as 
        the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far 
        as possible along each branch before backtracking. A version 
        of depth-first search was investigated in the 19th century by 
        French mathematician Charles Pierre TrÃ©maux as a strategy for 
        solving mazes. It is called DFS because it starts from the 
        root and follows each path to its greatest depth node (leaf/dead end)
        before backtracking and moving to the next node. A stack is used
        to store the nodes on the path from root node to the current
        node. In recusive version, the stack is implicit (call stack) 
        DFS works by searching deeper before it searches wider.

        Steps to perform DFS:
        1. Choose the initial vertex to visit and start exploring it
        2. Find the adjacent vertices to the initial vertex
        3. Visit any one of the adjacent vertices, suspend the exploration
        of the initial vertex by placing it on the stack and start exploring 
        its neighbor
        4. Repeat this process until the entire graph is traversed.

        The properties of a depth-first traversal of a graph are 
        as follows:
        - Visits all the vertices and edges of the graph
        - Determines whether the graph is connected
        - Computes the connected components of the graph
        - Computes a spanning forest of the graph

        Applications of dfs:
        - Find and report a path between two given vertices
        - Detect and find a cycle in the graph
        - Compute a graph's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
        - Find strongly connected components 
        - Topologically sort the vertices of a digraph/DAG
        - Find bridges/cut-edges/isthmus/cut-arc/articulation points of a graph
        - Find augmenting paths in a flow network
        - Generate mazes
        - Solving puzzles with only one solution, such as mazes
        - Planarity testing

        This method ouputs a labelling of the edges of the 
        graph as discovery and back edges.

        connected has exactly one component, consisting of the whole graph. 
        Components are sometimes called connected components. Additional
        examples include the following special cases:

        - Empty graph: In an empty graph, each vertex forms a component 
        with one vertex and zero edges. More generally, a component of 
        this type is formed for every isolated vertex in any graph.

        - Connected graph: In a connected graph, there is exactly one component,

        - Forest: In a forest, every component is a tree.

        - Cluster graph: In a cluster graph, every component is a maximal clique. 
        These graphs may be produced as the transitive closures of arbitrary undirected graphs,
